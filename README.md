ALU Regex Data Extraction

Project Overview

Regular expression or Regex is the process of extracting structured data from a large source of text data. In other words, it enables us to match and extract specific types of data like emails, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, timestamp, HTML tags, hashtags, and currency amounts, quickly and in an efficient manner.

Key Features:

*More Accurate Data Extraction: It employs well written regex patterns to extract data as expected.

*Supports Multiple Formats: Allows multiple formats for every data type (e.g., different styles for phone numbers, several currencies).

*Filters out too many invalid patterns (edge case handling)

*Simple and Scalable: Can compose to form  larger applications for data processing and validation.
